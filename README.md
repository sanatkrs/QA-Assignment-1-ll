<h1> AdidasTask-1-ll: API-Tests for the adidas homepage CMS response </h1>

This project is also the first task mention in the doc, however I have used here a different framwork and different approaches to extract the details from the json file. The framework I have used here is hybrid with the use of testNG, cucumber and Extent report for reporting. We can run  this project from runner class without any problem and in the end report can be seen in the report folder.
